# Personal portfolio 
Welcome to the README for my portfolio.  Written in React, making use of the JAMStack and served over a global CDN; I'm exploring the newest web technologies and moving beyond the safety of PHP and a web server.

## 🤔 What is JAMStack?
Javascript, API's, Markdown - the JAMStack is a growing way of approaching web development that prioritises speed, developer utility and overall performance.
From [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org):
> Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.

> When we talk about “The Stack”, we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.  
  
>The Jamstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.  
  
>Pre-rendered sites can be enhanced with JavaScript and the growing capabilities of browsers and services available via APIs.
## 💻 Technologies
At the very core of my portfolio is [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static-site generator that makes use of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - to manage content and deployment, I'm using the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) edge CDN along with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) on the backend.  A full list can be found below:

- GatsbyJS
- React
- NetlifyCMS
