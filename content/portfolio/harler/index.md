summary: In early 2020, Harler approached me in need of a new website to support
  their exciting relaunching of the company.  This was to include large volumes
  of content and a strong company brand.

Harler had a few key points in mind with their rebrand: consistency, readability, and a rich variety of content that was intuitive to access.   With the volume of content in mind, I set out on building the site to specification - paying strong attention to accessibility and ease of use for the end user at all times.

When building for a system such as Wordpress, it's so important to build a set of "templates" as part of the theme.  As important as the homepage is, the pages listing posts in each category, the pages containing posts themselves and the error pages are instrumental to a smooth user experience and consistent style.  With that said, there were a number of challenges I faced, especially given that I had not built a Wordpress theme before.  Each category page was to have a "sub-navigation" to provide access to the other categories - this is something that Wordpress doesn't natively support.  Another difficulty was setting the "active" class on the appropriate navigation bar item.  This is because there were both page links and anchor links on the home page - a lot of PHP, Javascript and time went into a solution for this.

I did also write a number of custom plugins for Harler, these were mostly to add additional "content types" such as team members and "sectors" for the homepage.  I was then able to implement custom "short codes" for these such that they could be included in future posts if necessary.

Overall this project was both a fantastic opportunity and an important learning process, by the end of it I actually felt quite at home in the Wordpress development environment, something I never thought I'd say.
